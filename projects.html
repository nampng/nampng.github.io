                <h1>Senior Design Project - Helmet HUD System - 2nd place</h1>
                <img src="/img/helmet.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    My team developed a multifunction system that was capable of providing location information, teammate tracking, and wireless communications. All information was then projected onto an augmented reality display, which allowed the user to maintain situationally aware of the environment around them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The heart of the system was a Raspberry Pi 4 with a BerryIMU v4 and LoRA transceiver. The Pi was responsible for wireless communications, calculations, and location services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The augmented reality display was achieved by using a NorthStar Deck X headset, Intel RealSense T261 tracking module, and the Panda3D game engine.

                    There were a lot of pitfalls and obstacles when doing this project. I had to quickly learn on the spot and be proactive in protyping and testing as the project had time and budget constraints. We did not have the same amount of guidance that the corporate sponsored teams had, so we were usually poking around in the dark until we found something that worked. There were times where we doubted if we could even see our project to the end, but through determination we managed to create a working prototype and place among the top three at the Senior Design Expo.

                    This I've learned from this project:
                <ul>
                    <li>Even More Python</li>
                    <li>Bluetooth (Was our original wireless communication method)</li>
                    <li>GPS</li>
                    <li>LoRA</li>
                    <li>Panda3D</li>
                    <li>Intel RealSense API</li>
                    <li>Hard work and determination is the key</li>

                <h1>Desktop Application - ImgToPDF - Done</h1>
                <p>
                    I wanted to be able to stitch together images into a PDF so I could turn in my assignments, but some softwares out there had free trials or had some wierd functionality to them. So I made my own using Python.

                    This project gave me some insight into GUI, processing images, and processing PDFs. Though its a very simple program, I'm pretty proud of it because I'll be able to use it everyday.

                <h1>Web Application - Task Master - Ongoing</h1>
                <p>
                    It's easy to lose discipline and ruin your routine when it comes to studying, working out, or doing
                    chores.

                <p>
                    I want to make a web app that will time tasks, remind the user about tasks, and summarize a user's
                    day of new tasks and completed tasks.

                <h1>Desktop Application - Bill Splitter - Ongoing</h1>
                <p>
                    Splitting the bill can be a huge pain after a few nights of eating out with friends. I wanted to
                    create a tool that provides the user with an easy to use GUI that will help them organize and split
                    the bill.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I plan on using C# and the WPF framework.
